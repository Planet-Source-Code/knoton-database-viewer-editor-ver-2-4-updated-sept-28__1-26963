### Description

Updated: Dec 02 2001, Ver 2.5 updates are functionality to associate MS Access (.mdb) databases with Database viewer/editor, and to

Maximaze the application.

View/Edit data on databases that can be MS SQL-Server local/lan or remote on internet, or a MS Access database. Get Data by clicking databases/tables/columns/views/stored procedures or perform custom SQL queries.

It shows ADO Programming and Some API.

In this version I have fixed some bugs from previous releases and improved the functionality.

Now you can view the "source" of all stored procedures and views in SQL-Server.

Thanks to all who came with feedback/suggestions in previous versions of this application.

The project is made with VB 6.0 Service Pack 5 and I used MDAC 2.5.

Please help me grow as a programmer and come with feedback/suggestions.
